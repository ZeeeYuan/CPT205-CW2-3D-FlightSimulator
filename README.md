# CPT205-CW2-3D-FlightSimulator
This is the CW2 3D FlightSimulator for CPT205 Computer Graphics in XJTLU  
The .cpp file can be compiled and executed in Visual Studio without any extra operations  
But remember to load the files in Textures to the same directory of the .cpp  file  
Interaction operations are written in details in report, feel free to check  
Hope this can help you
